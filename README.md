## Lighthouse


## Trade-offs / Decisions
- Directly used some of the images/icons pulled from Figma instead of react-icons for consistency
- Some parts of the code could be better componentized. I didnâ€™t go as far as I could here due to both limited experience in that area and time considerations.
- Worked on getting most of the core items on Task 2 (Hero + CTA). With more time, I would work on polishing it out a bit more (hover states, better alignment, cleaning up project structure a bit better). 
- Focused on mobile-first responsiveness. Desktop layouts work, but could use more refinement with additional time.
